# mech_test
This test contain two assignments.Both the assignments are quite simple, with the first assignment dealing with temperature forecasting, while the second assignment being a regression model.

                       Assignment 1 - Time Series Forecasting (using Weather_data.csv)

Predict the temperature column ‘ _tempm’ for Delhi, using Time Series Forecasting.  
Share your understanding of underlying data using descriptive analytics (You’re encouraged to do data cleaning as well).  
For prediction, try multiple available techniques and choose the best performing model.  
Does a time series model developed using deep learning techniques give more accurate predictions?
Model must take a date as input and output the probable temperature for that day (so basically forecast to the given date and then   report the value of that date).  
You are allowed to use the other accompanying features as input as well and create a multi-variate forecasting model.
The training data is available from Jan 1996 - Nov 2016. We will use data from Dec 2016 - April 2017 to check the model accuracy/validity.

                                 Assignment 2 - Regression (Expander_data.csv)

Develop a model, to predict the column 'Discharge Pressure (psig)' minimizing ‘rmse’ loss function.  
You are encouraged to try out different techniques from ML/DL and share comparative results. 
Please refrain from using very complex architectures in case of deploying deep learning algorithms. 
You’re allowed to do any feature engineering/feature selection you deem necessary. 
We will use a test set to check the model performance.
